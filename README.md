# geotrails
A simple project to connect the geographic dots. 

MVP: 
Have a user enter at least two locations. These locations are geocoded, stored, and displayed on a map. Lines are drawn connecting the points.

Platform:

We'll likely use CartoDB as backend and Mapzen Search for geocoding. JS for frontend, with Leaflet and D3, if needed.

Intent:
Hummanize migration, migration histories
connect to current events
Map is explicitly political
Start with person, then go back by generation
Technology as a tool, diversity


Context:
Refugee law was written for European displaced persons, have been ammended over time
Migration and Renewal complexities and hardships of migration
